description: Take one implementation issue from the issue tracker to a verified draft PR. Check that it is dispatchable, claim it, build and verify the change, open the draft PR, work the hosted checks, and close the issue out once the PR merges.

The user hands you one implementation issue: an id like `ABC-123`, or its URL. One run takes it to one verified **draft** PR, then works the hosted checks until the PR is ready for the maintainer. Merging is never yours; closeout waits for the merge.

This skill is one of the factory's `do-` skills and expects its siblings to be installed alongside it. It checks issues against `do-refine`'s [dispatch-gates.md](../do-refine/dispatch-gates.md) and reads the lifecycle from its [brief-template.md](../do-refine/brief-template.md).

## Workspace values

This skill holds the procedure. The tracker values (statuses, labels, repo routing, dispatch targets, comment shape, PR rules) live in the repo's **tracker doc**. Find it through `AGENTS.md`; if `AGENTS.md` doesn't name one, use `docs/issue-tracker.md`. Read it before you touch the tracker. Where this file says "per X", X is a heading in that doc.

Repo commands (typecheck, tests, the full check or preflight, how to run the app and sign in, the PR template) live in the repo's `AGENTS.md` and the docs it links. So do the repo's own rules for the code: playbooks the change must follow, files never to edit.

If a value or command you need is missing, ask the user, use their answer, then offer to add it to the tracker doc or `AGENTS.md`, or to run `do-factory-setup`.

Read and write the tracker only through the access the tracker doc's **Tracker** heading allows. If that access is unavailable or unauthorized, stop and say so; don't fall back to a browser, desktop app or raw API.

**Asking.** While the user is in the session, ask in chat (AskUserQuestion where the client has it). In a cloud run with nobody there, ask through a tracker comment instead; see [step 3](#3-ask-before-guessing).

## 1. Read and check

1. **One issue.** If the user names several, ask which to take first.
2. **Fetch** the issue and its comments, and state its title. Comments can amend the brief; read them all.
3. **Dispatchable.** It must be an implementation issue (no `wayfinder:` label), in the ready status per **Issue statuses**, and pass every gate in [dispatch-gates.md](../do-refine/dispatch-gates.md): in particular, every blocker done and no open human gate. An issue already in progress and assigned to you by a dispatch integration also counts. If it fails, stop and say which gate.
4. **Repo.** Read the repo tag from the description. If it has none, resolve it per **Repo routing** and add the tag before starting, as the first line of the **Agent brief**, where [brief-template.md](../do-refine/brief-template.md) puts it. Check that this checkout's `origin` is that repo, and run the cross-check **Repo routing** gives. If the repo can't be resolved, isn't this checkout, or anything disagrees, stop and say which repo the issue needs. Never guess, and never work in another repo.
5. **Context.** Read the brief's Context, the decisions and specs it links, and the files on its **Touches:** line. Use the repo's domain language if it keeps a glossary.

## 2. Claim

Before any other work: assign the issue to yourself, move it to the in-progress status, and set the dispatch target label per **Dispatch targets**.

Pick the label from the host environment, not from the model you run on. The tracker doc says which signal maps to which label; hosts usually announce themselves through environment variables (for example an Orca or Conductor workspace id). Use a plain CLI label (for example Claude or Codex) only when no orchestrator's signal is set. If a dispatch integration already claimed the issue, only check the label.

If you can't start after claiming (the repo won't build, access is missing), comment on the issue with what blocks it and what comes next, unassign yourself, and move it back to the ready status.

## 3. Ask before guessing

When the brief leaves a product or design fork open, or its acceptance criteria conflict with the code, don't guess. Ask the user. With nobody in the session, post a tracker comment per **Comment shape** with the question and the options you see, move the issue back to the ready status, and stop.

A small, reversible call inside the brief's requirements is yours to make. Note it in the PR summary.

## 4. Build

1. **Branch.** Name it per **Pull requests**; if the doc is silent, use the branch name the tracker gives the issue. Before the first commit, compare the current branch with that name and rename it (`git branch -m <name>`) if they differ; orchestrators often create their own prefixed branches. A host that must choose its own branch name (for example a Cursor Cloud agent) keeps it. If the repo's PR autopilot needs a label for that branch, per **Pull requests**, apply it when you open the PR.
2. **Test first.** Where the change has a testable seam, call the `tdd` skill and write the failing test before the code. Without the skill, follow the same red-green loop by hand.
3. **Check as you go.** Run the repo's typecheck and the test files you touch, per `AGENTS.md`.
4. **Stay in scope.** Build only the brief's requirements, and respect its **Out of scope**. File anything else you find as a new issue in the triage status per **Issue statuses**: a short title, what you saw, this issue's project, and a Product label when the product is obvious. Keep it flat (no parent issue, even if a host tool offers one) and link it to this issue as related. Link it in the PR too.
5. **Follow the repo's rules.** Follow every repo playbook the change touches, and never edit what `AGENTS.md` says not to.

## 5. See it work

For changes a person can see or use (UI, sign-in), run the app per `AGENTS.md` and walk each acceptance criterion by hand, in a browser where there is one. Write the steps you took as a numbered **Test plan** for the PR, in the format the repo's docs set, if any. Changes nobody can see skip this step.

## 6. Review your own diff

Call the `code-review` skill on the diff against the default branch (or make an equally careful pass by hand). Fix what it finds, or say in the PR summary why a finding stands.

## 7. Verify and push

1. Merge the latest default branch and commit everything. Commits use plain imperative subjects.
2. Run the repo's full check, per `AGENTS.md`.
3. Push only the commit that passed. Push unverified only when the maintainer authorizes that specific push.

## 8. Open the draft PR

- **Title** per **Pull requests**: a plain imperative subject ending with the issue id in parentheses, like `Fix the login redirect bug (ABC-123)`.
- **Body:** the repo's PR template, if it has one. Include the verification output, the Test plan from step 5, the calls you made under step 3, links to any issues you filed, and any doc closeout line `AGENTS.md` asks for. Put the issue id in the body too, so the tracker links the PR.
- Open it as a **draft**. Never mark it ready by hand.
- Post the **PR opened** comment per **Comment shape** on the issue. The issue stays in progress; only the automation named under **Issue statuses** moves it to review. If a host tool offers to change the status when the PR opens, skip that.

## 9. Work the hosted checks

Wait for the checks with the host's PR monitor if it has one, otherwise `gh pr checks <number> --watch`.

- **PR autopilot** (per **Pull requests**): it posts a verdict for each head commit. On "ready", stop and report the PR and its verdict. On "needs a fix", follow its hand-back steps in order.
- **No PR autopilot:** when every check passes, stop and report the PR. The maintainer reviews, marks it ready and merges.
- **A failure:** reproduce it locally, fix its cause, then repeat step 7 and push.
- After **three** fix rounds that still fail, stop. Comment on the PR and the issue with what is still failing and what you tried.

A cloud session that ends before the checks finish is fine; a later session picks up from the PR.

## After the merge

Closeout happens only once the PR has merged: in a later session the user starts, or in this one if the user merges while you're still here. An unmerged PR never makes the issue done, however green its checks.

1. Set the issue to the done status (the tracker's automation may already have).
2. Link the merged PR on the issue.
3. Check off the acceptance criteria that are met.
4. Post a completion comment with a dateline per **Comment shape**: what landed, and any follow-ups. Post it even when the tracker's automation already set the issue done; it's the record that closeout ran.
5. Do any doc closeout the repo's `AGENTS.md` asks for.
6. If the issue sits on a map, update the map per [do-refine's Maps section](../do-refine/SKILL.md#maps). Set the map to its finished status only when its Destination is reached and no open issues remain.

If only some criteria landed, the issue stays in progress, with a comment saying what landed and what remains.

## Boundaries

- One issue, one PR.
- Never merge the PR or mark it ready.
- Never set the review or done status, or post a completion comment, before the merge.
- Never set priority beyond what **Priority** says.
- Never push unverified work without the maintainer's say-so for that push.
- Stop and ask rather than guess when the brief leaves a product decision open.
