# AGENTS.md

Factory holds workflow skills and, later, the code, contracts and configs behind them. See the [README](README.md) for what each skill does.

## Issue tracker

The workspace values the skills read are in [`docs/issue-tracker.md`](docs/issue-tracker.md).

## Tool stack

The tool stack and its defaults live in Linear. [`docs/issue-tracker.md`](docs/issue-tracker.md#tool-stack) links the document.

## Scripts

Write scripts in TypeScript by default, run directly with Node (no build step). Use Python 3 with only the standard library for tools that ship into repos regardless of their stack, like Factory Verify, or when Python's standard library makes the script much simpler, like parsing TOML. Don't add Ruby, or shell scripts longer than a few lines.

## Where things go

The repo is organised by kind of thing. Add a folder only when its first file lands; never commit empty folders.

- **Skills:** `skills/<name>/`, with `SKILL.md` and `agents/openai.yaml`.
- **Shared code:** `packages/<name>/`.
- **Stack packs:** `packs/<name>/`.
- **Tool configs:** `tools/<name>/`.
- **Prose contracts:** `docs/<contract>.md`.
- **Glossary:** `GLOSSARY.md` at the root. Add or change a term in the PR that brings it in.
- **Example config and schemas:** `*.example` files and machine-readable schemas sit beside the code that reads them. The real config is gitignored: add its path to `.gitignore` in the same PR.

## Open source

This repo is built to be published. Never commit secrets, personal data, machine names, workspace ids or relay URLs. Use placeholders such as `ABC-123` for ticket ids, and commit `*.example` files instead of real config. The one exception is `docs/issue-tracker.md`: it is McWestling's real tracker config, committed so cloud agents can read it, and it holds nothing private.
